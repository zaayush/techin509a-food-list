For Gravy Puree:

In a cooking pot, bring some water to a boil.
Add roughly chopped onions and whole spices (cinnamon, green cardamom, peppercorn, black cardamom, cloves).
Boil for 10-15 minutes.
Allow the mixture to cool, remove the whole spices, and then make a paste from the remaining onion.
For Chicken Marination:

In a bowl, combine the chicken with salt, black pepper powder, kitchen king masala, lemon juice, ginger garlic paste, and green chili paste.
Mix well and marinate the chicken for 15 minutes.
For Chicken Kali Mirch Gravy:

Heat oil and ghee in a large cooking kadai (wok).
Add the whole spices (black cardamom, cloves, peppercorn, and cinnamon) to release their aroma.
Add the onion paste and cook it until it becomes golden brown.
Add ginger-garlic paste and green chili paste and cook until the oil starts to ooze out.
Stir in the whisked curd and cook until the oil and ghee separate from the mixture.
Add the marinated chicken and mix well. Cook until the chicken is half-done.
Add the cashew paste mixed in water to avoid lump formation and make a smooth gravy.
Add more kitchen king masala, black pepper powder, and kasuri methi. Mix well and let it cook for a while.
Finish the dish with cream and let it simmer.
Garnish with fresh coriander and black pepper.
Serve the Chicken Kali Mirch hot, and enjoy your delicious meal!
